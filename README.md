This is a small Monte Carlo code designed to simulate filling of a 
carbon nanotube in water. If no standard input is given, program will 
prompt for run parameters. 

Mathematica notebooks include other methods for tackling the problem (directly 
enumerating all of the states, etc.) and some plots and analysis.
